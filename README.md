# Conversions

#    Program that takes "rods" and converts them to meters,\
#    feet, miles furlongs, and minutes to walk
#
#    The first section of code is where the user inputs a number
#    The number then results in the number of rods in the format\
#    of a float 
#
#    The next sction(middle) is where I diplay the convesion string
#    I make sure that the num_str1 variable converts to a float
#
#    The third section of code is the conversion 
#    This is where the rods are converted into meters, feet,\
#    miles, furlongs, and minutes to walk
#    
#    By Using mathematics I was able to convert each piece correctly 
#    The core of this project is the num_str1 variable
